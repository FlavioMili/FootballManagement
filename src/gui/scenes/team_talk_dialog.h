 * @brief Modal pre-match / half-time team talk of the managed club.
 *
 * Self-contained: keep one instance per match screen. Either call open() and
 * render() yourself, or let renderForMatch() drive it from the live engine:
 * it opens the pre-match talk at kick-off and the half-time talk at the
 * break.
 *
 * Each tone shows its predicted reception in this situation (score, stakes,
 * the players' personalities); the result lists how the XI took it. Besides
 * a few morale points, the talk's outcome (GameController::getTeamTalkModifier)
 * reaches the live match: sharper (or shakier) decisions, execution and
 * pressing for the first minutes of the half (MatchEngine::getTeamTalkEffect).
