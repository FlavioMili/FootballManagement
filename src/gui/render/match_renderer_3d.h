/**
 * Stylised 3D broadcast renderer.
 *
 * Projects a metric world through a perspective camera on the CPU and draws
 * the result as ImDrawList triangles, so it shares the SDL_Renderer/ImGui
 * path with the 2D view. Static geometry (pitch, markings, stands, crowd,
 * boards, goals) is built once and only re-projected; players, ball and goal
 * parts are depth-sorted back to front each frame (painter's algorithm) with
 * near-plane clipping for ground polygons. Consumes only the read-only
 * snapshot and never touches the simulation.
