// This file can be used for global constants, enums, and functions
// that are used across the entire project.

// For example:
// const int MAX_PLAYERS_PER_TEAM = 30;

// The previous Role and Stats enums have been removed
// as this logic is now data-driven and loaded from
// assets/stats_config.json to allow for greater modularity.
