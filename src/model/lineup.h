 *
 *   GK: (always separate, fixed role)
 *
 *   Row 0 → furthest forward (attacking line)
 *   Row 4 → deepest outfield line (defensive line)
 *
 *   Example 5×5 grid (row × col):
 *
 *       (0,0)   (0,1)   (0,2)   (0,3)   (0,4)
 *       (1,0)   (1,1)   (1,2)   (1,3)   (1,4)
 *       (2,0)   (2,1)   (2,2)   (2,3)   (2,4)
 *       (3,0)   (3,1)   (3,2)   (3,3)   (3,4)
 *       (4,0)   (4,1)   (4,2)   (4,3)   (4,4)
 *
 * To place a player in a position, use:
 *   index = row * LINEUP_GRID_COLS + col;
 *
 * Example: Striker at (0,2) → index = 0 * 5 + 2 = 2
 *          Left-back at (4,0) → index = 4 * 5 + 0 = 20
