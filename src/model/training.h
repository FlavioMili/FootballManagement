/**
 * @file training.h
 * @brief Weekly training microcycle, workload, individual focus and tactical
 * familiarity.
 *
 * A club trains to a template of six days between two matches (MD+1 recovery,
 * MD+2 off, MD-4 strength, MD-3 endurance, MD-2 speed/tactics, MD-1
 * activation; rules-regulations 5.1, world-realism 8). The template is mapped
 * onto the real fixture list every day; weeks with two matches collapse to
 * recovery and activation only when auto-adjust is on.
 *
 * Effects (all bounded around the Balanced preset, which reproduces the
 * calibrated world simulation):
 * - Each session adds training load to a player's acute (7-day) and chronic
 *   (28-day) workload. Load spikes relative to recent history raise the
 *   injury hazard modestly (x1.0-1.5); a high chronic load is mildly
 *   protective (x0.9) (world-realism 2.6/9.2: no magic ratio).
 * - Sessions drain condition, recovery and rest days speed recovery.
 * - The week's volume, the preset mix and the staff scale the development
 *   rate (T = 0.7-1.3) and steer growth towards the drilled attributes.
 * - Tactical and match-preparation sessions build familiarity with the
 *   current strategy and shape; changing either costs familiarity.
