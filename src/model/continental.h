/**
 * @brief Continental club competitions: rules, draws and tables.
 *
 * Every competition has a league phase (Swiss model: each club meets
 * `matches` different opponents, one at home and one away from each pot,
 * never a club of its own association and at most two of any other), after
 * which places 1-8 go straight to the round of 16, places 9-24 play a
 * two-legged play-off and the rest are out. Knockout ties have two legs
 * (no away goals; extra time and penalties when the aggregate is level) and
 * the final is a single match at a neutral venue.
 *
 * Matches are ordinary calendar fixtures with MatchType::CONTINENTAL, the
 * competition ID and a stage code (stageCode()).
