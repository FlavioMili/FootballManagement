/**
 * @brief The human side of management: one-to-one conversations, promises,
 * team talks and the dressing room of the managed club.
 *
 * Design rules (research D-14, FR-119..FR-123):
 * - Interactions change morale points and the player's trust in the manager;
 *   they never touch results directly. The only performance knobs exposed
 *   (team talk and cohesion modifiers) are bounded to +-2% and are read-only
 *   hints for the match engine.
 * - Conversations are rare and consequential: every option has a cooldown
 *   and the player's reply depends on his personality, form against what his
 *   squad role demands, trust and the manager's standing.
 * - Every promise has a measurable condition and a deadline and always ends
 *   Kept, Broken or Voided (with a reason).
