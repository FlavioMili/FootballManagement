 * `timeMinute` is the match clock: the first half runs from 0 to 45 plus its
 * added time, the second half restarts at 45. `addedMinute` is the part of
 * the clock beyond the regulation end of the period (0 when not in added
 * time), so "45+2'" is timeMinute 47 in period 1 with addedMinute 2.
 * `hasTeam`/`isHomeTeam` describe the side of the primary player (for an
 * OWN_GOAL that is the defender's side; the goal counts for the other side).
 * For goals the secondary player is the assist provider, for fouls the
 * fouled player, for substitutions the outgoing player and for saves the
